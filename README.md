- 👋 Hi, I’m RickLaviolette. I am 70 years old. When I was born 10 UFOs flew over the White House. My brother, his wife and I witnessed one behind his home in 1974. That is when people knew you nuts for seeing something that isn't real. So I guess the military has gone nuts too. I was in the USAF when we had a draft. But hey! I got 3 pair of shoes and a "Greetings" from Uncle Sam.  
- I th
- ink I have a working theory of how a UFO operates. Nobody believes it.
- 👀 I’m interested in modding F4, New Vegas, Fallout 3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "outdated modding requirements are no longer available. Ones Like this one: (Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) for the plugin from: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555) A list of mods won't perfom well without MCM which requires it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing a UFO. I need someone to concur or shoot holes in the thought. I am 70 and have studied nearly unavailable information for years.
